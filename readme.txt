### The hottest Pinterest Plugin on the Block

Advanced Pins provides the most popular Pinterest features without the price and is <b>built right into the Block Editor</b>.

We upgrade the Image and Gallery blocks for Pinterest optimization, and provide new Document controls for the entire post.

* <b>Opt an image out</b> of the Hover Save Button
* Make any images a <b>Hidden Pinterest Image</b>

#### Galleries
* Set a description to use for <b>each image in that gallery</b>
* Instantly create a <b>Hidden Pin Gallery</b>
* Easily set as many <b>Hidden Pinterst Images</b> as you desire

#### Hover Save Button
* Choose from three styles: Classic, Bold, and Round
* Customize the text to say anything you would like (Classic and Bold only)
* Decide where on the image you want the button to appear
* Customize your own button style using the CSS selector `#apx-hover-pin-button`

#### Document controls
* Choose to use a single <b>Force Pin Image</b> for the post
* Set a default <b>Pinterest Description</b> for all images on the page

### Pinterest API Integration

Because we use Pinterest's own JavaScript SDK, our code will always be in sync with the latest Pinterest trends and features.
Every click of the Save button pings opens a window by calling the Pinterest API to show a new Pin with the Image, Description, and Media you have set.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
<b>Question:</b> Is Advanced Pins compatible with my other Pinterest plugins?

<b>Answer</b>
Advanced Pins may work with your other Pinterest plugins, depending on how they affect the DOM (the images on your page). If the other plugin touches the `data-pin-description` or other data-attributes, then there may be Block Editor errors when both plugins are active. 

However, if your other plugins do not touch images, then you can have them both running side by side! 

== Screenshots ==
1. Simple, straightforward plugin settings.
2. Control your Pinterest settings on a per-image basis with the Image block
3. Set a batch of settings for an entire gallery of images with the Gallery block
4. Use the Document settings to Force Pin an image or set a default Description
